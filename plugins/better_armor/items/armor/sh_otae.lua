ITEM.name = "Overwatch Elite armor"
ITEM.description = "Designed for the top of the line transhumans of the union, the Elite Overwatch Armor manages to do more with the same space and weight of its predecesor. The kevlar and fibers are made with such density, it is likely the limited amount of such armors is due to industrial and manufacturing complications of making such armor. The EOW armor manages to not use any off-world components, making it a feasable product for human design, although the manufacturing processes to make such a lightweight yet powerful armor might be something impossible to do, even for the humanity of the oldworld. This armor is a sign of fear and hopelessness for many refugees and rebels out there."
