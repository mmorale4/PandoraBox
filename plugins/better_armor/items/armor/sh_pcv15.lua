ITEM.name = "Archon Michael Simmons Armor"
ITEM.description = "A legendary armor of impossible design, the intricate design seems to have been formed by the most legendary of artisans. The armor itself appears similar, if not superior, to the impossibility of the same plating that Neo Heavies carry with. Even so, it is evident that the metal *within* the suit moves along with the user, as it can be worn as seamlessly as normal clothing. The sounds of a mechanical exo-skeleton can be heard inside, increasing the capabilities of the wearer beyond believe. A legendary artifact produced by Archon-1, its creation is as much of a feat as the wonders humanity have built over the years."
