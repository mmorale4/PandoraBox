ITEM.name = "Alpha Team Armor Mk.I"
ITEM.description = "An armor of uncommon looks, the design within it appears to be of late pos-lambda European design. Outfitted of carefully dynamicaly placed kevlar patches, the MK. 1 armor provides great protection, while barely sacrificing any mobility or space. Using particular kevlar patterns developed with xen and earthly materials, the vest itself feels way more lightweight than what it looks. Providing not only a full vest of protection, the armor also provides leg and arm pieces, that use the same ergonomic kevlar design. Neck protection is granted as well, and finally, the armor holds a cooling and powered system similar to the Powered Combat vests, employed by the combine."
