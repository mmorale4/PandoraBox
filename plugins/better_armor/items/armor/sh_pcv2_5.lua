ITEM.description = "During the later stages of the aftermath of the fall of city 17, rebel remnants found a rising problem dealing with fire and pulse as a whole. With the newly mass produced U.U ammunition type, 'Kebrinium', humanity was in need of a new armor design that was easily available, while providing much better protection against tthese problems. Although no one is sure who designed this armor, the PCV 2.5 was spread out to all remaining rebel cells in mass production, along with blueprints to build such armor. A PCV vest adorned in a strange color due to its covering of Starlite, a intumescent material, the PCV 2.5 makes the user nearly completely immune to fire, while offering the same normal protection of the PCV 2.0"
