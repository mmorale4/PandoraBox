ITEM.description = "A massive set of armor, amounting to what was essentially a wearable fortress, made mobile. The composition of the equipment is a set of Overwatch armor worn under a specially adjusted suit of Bastion Metal Armor, providing an extra layer of protection. The armor seems designed to be durable, and protect from the elements to a decent degree, allowing for sustained combat with minimal to no support when the need arises. While the Overwatch armor is simply worn as one usually would, the Bastion armor is fastened over with buckles, straps, and friction, covering armor with armor, and skin with steel."
