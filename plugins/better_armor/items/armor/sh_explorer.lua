ITEM.description = "Combine military-grade armor, originally built for a paramilitary corporation that enforced law and order in a North America left devastated by portal storms prior to the Seven Hour War. The original plating is seen as a status symbol among Outland mercenaries, the protection and mobility it offers is incredible -- though its original wearers were often woefully short-lived. This remake has included a cloaking device & external, internal temperature regulation requiring an active biosignal to fit. Adds 2 inches to height. Legendary item."
