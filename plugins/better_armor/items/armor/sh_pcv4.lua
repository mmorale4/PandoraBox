ITEM.name = "PCV 4: Steamroller Powered Combat Armor"
ITEM.description = "A superior brother to the fabled Juggernaut armor. Designed by the Combine, it holds several similarities to Juggernaut in terms of stopping power and strength, however the Combine designed it with flexibility and mobility in mind, making it a far more lightweight option. Comes with a comfortable helmet, the vest itself with several ammo holders and pouches, shoulder pads, calf and thigh pads. The PCV 4.0 was distributed to Universal Union heavy units, such as SENTINEL, REAPER, WARHAMMER, and other trashuman designs in the later stages of 2019. Not only is the armor all encompassing and protective, it also holds the utilities of its previous brethren, while also maximizing the powered shock absorbtion. 9mm gunfire is not even felt while wearing this armor, and .50 calibers feel like being hit with a bat, instead of being hit by a car."
