ITEM.name = "'Armadillo Plating'"
ITEM.description = "An armor spun out of Alpha Team armor, the design within it appears to be of late pos-lambda European design mixed with specially placed combine shavings. Mixed with the strategic placed kevlar, it makes for a formidable design; providing well-protection whilst sacrificing barely any mobility or weight. Using particular kevlar patterns developed with xen and earthly materials; aswell as the alloy, the vest itself feels way more lightweight than what it looks. Providing not only a full vest full of protection, the armor provides leg and arm pieces, that use the same ergonomic kevlar design. Neck protection is granted as well, alas the system holds a Cooling & Powered system, similar to that of Powered Combat Vests employed by the Combine"
