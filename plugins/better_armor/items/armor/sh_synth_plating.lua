ITEM.description = "The same plating found in OF-1 synths, and OF-2 synths in a greater extent, synthetic plating is lightweight enough to be worn, yet it is so durable it is very likely the user within it will break first from the impacts of what is hurting them before the armor even breaks. The material is definetly off-world, and was present ever since the seven hour war. Although these armors are obviously present in all low-grade synthetics, not many human-compatible designs are present. The armor feels as uncomfortable and stiff as metal itself, yet it somehow feels somewhat... fleshy."
