ITEM.name = "Bastion Scrap Metal Armor"
ITEM.description = "A heavy set of steel and iron plating, covering one’s entire body save for the head, held in place by leather straps and buckles. The design of the armor is more similar to that of a knight’s than scrap armor, with fine and careful craftsmanship evident. While the armor covers the body, range of motion is nearly unrestricted, with joints left somewhat exposed. The thickness of the plating varies from 1/2 to 1/3 of an inch all around. Protruding from the torso is a large metal collar, and shoulder guards, held on by rivets and welds."
